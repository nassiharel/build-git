  # This is an example script. The script is used to stop the Time to Assignment SLA field,
  # once an owner was set to an incident. If you want to use this script, you should go to
  # the Owner field, and set this script as the script to run upon change of field value.

  if not demisto.args().get('old') and demisto.args().get('new'):  # If owner was no-one and is now someone:
      demisto.executeCommand("stopTimer", {"timerField": "timetoassignment"})
      demisto.results("Assignment of the incident was successful and so the Time To Assignment"
                      " timer has been stopped.")
