The QRadar admin creates rules for detecting suspicious traffic, suspicious IDs, etc., and runs searches to obtain additional data about these offences.\n\n## What does this pack do?\nThe integration in this pack automatically fetches the offences from QRadar along with all the additional data about the offenses. The data from QRadar is populated into XSOAR incident fields providing the XSOAR analyst with all the information about the incident just by performing a fetch. \n\nUsing the commands in the integration, you can leverage what the QRadar API has to offer, such as:\n- Editing objects\n- Getting object lists\n- Adding notes\nBasically, you can perform tasks that a user would need to do manually in the QRadar UI or would need to provide automations to do.\n\n_For more information, visit our [Cortex XSOAR Developer Docs](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/packs/QRadar)._\n\n_If you're new to our QRadar Content Pack, check out our [Ingest Incidents from a SIEM Using QRadar](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/cortex-xsoar/6-2/cortex-xsoar-tutorials/tutorials/ingest-incidents-from-a-siem.html) tutorial._\n",
