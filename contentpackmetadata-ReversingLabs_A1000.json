The REST Services APIs enable analysts to input suspected samples, access unpacked files and view extracted Proactive Threat Indicators (PTIs). The A1000 also calculates each fileâ€™s Threat Level to help with determination of remediation priorities. The platform performs an in-depth static analysis of a comprehensive array of file types including Windows, Linux, Mac OS, iOS, Android, Windows Mobile, email attachments, documents and\nfirmware.\n\nThis pack provides Cortex XSOAR integrations created by ReversingLabs that allow seamless and effective use of A1000 services through the Cortex XSOAR interface.\n\n#### Currently available integrations:\n- ReversingLabs A1000 v2\n    - Enables the use of a wide range of A1000 services.\n    - The included commands can be used separately in the War Room or as part of a playbook.\n\nThis pack also includes 1 playbook:\n- **Detonate File - ReversingLabs A1000**: Upload sample to ReversingLabs A1000 appliance and automatically retrieve the analysis report.\n\nNote: Support for this pack moved to the partner on April 22nd 2021. Please contact the partner directly via the support link on the right.",
